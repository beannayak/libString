While doing projects using string in c
I feel short of function similar to string.split()
so I created the function and many other which are 
useful while doing some projects in string manipulation in C.

Check what are the function included in include\myString.h

USE
just put the lib and include folder in your gcc's lib and include

use #include <myString.h>
compile using -lstring
      $ gcc -o main.out main.c -lstring
